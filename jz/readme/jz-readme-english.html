		<h2>Overview</h2><br>

		<p>
			The Jerry Zinger Show allows the PC and his companions to view (and take part in) the live talk show of Jerry Zinger, well known Amnish celebrity! Shows are daily, and executed largely by cutscenes. The programme is as follows:
		</p>
		<div class="important">
		  <ol>
			<li>"My ex is an evil mastermind" (Irenicus, Ellesime)</li>
			<li>"Racial tension" (Korgan)</li>
			<li>"Leaving with my lover" (Rumar)</li>
			<li>"Families Reunited" (Aerie)</li>
			<li>No name (Newb)</li>
			<li>"Knights who wear Lingerie and and the women who love them" (Keldorn)</li>
			<li>"Latex Gnomes" (Seifer, SConrad)</li>
			<li>"My husband's mistress" (Keldorn)</li>
			<li>"Who's your daddy?" (Aerie)</li>
		  </ol>
		</div><br>

		<p>
			Note that the episodes featuring a NPC are only viewable if the NPC is currently in the party, and not dead. The other episodes are viewable no matter what party you have. You will not be able to choose which episode to view. They will display in the given order where possible.
		</p><br>

		<p><strong>Key features</strong>
		</p>
		  <ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li><strong>Fully Fledged Introduction Movie!</strong> SConrad and Jezil'jin have together created an introduction movie, and with SConrad's pioneering technique it has been included in the mod.</li>
			<li><strong>New Area!</strong> A new area based on the Playhouse, made by BLUE_CHIP, is included in the mod. This area is the Jerry Zinger Studio where the episodes play out. The Jerry Zinger Studio is available through the the Den of Seven Vales, the inn north of the Circus in Waukeen's Promenade. The entrance is located on the south-east wall of the first floor of the inn, just slightly to the right of the point where you first enter the Den of Seven Vales.</li>
			<li><strong>Comprehensive Voicing!</strong> Jerry Zinger is voiced by TheWizard, and SConrad and Seifer are also voicing themselves. Aerie's (two) fathers, Sir William of Thorpe, and Rumar are voiced by Shed and Tris.</li>
		  </ul><br>

		<h2>Compatibility</h2><br>

		<h3>Games supported</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Jerry Zinger Show is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. <strong>Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.</strong> Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.</li>
			<li>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE).</li>
			<li>The conversion projects based on <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>: <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/"><strong>Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases"><strong>Enhanced Edition Trilogy</strong></a> (EET).</li>
		</ul><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Other Mods Compatibility</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			This mod is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. Though we are striving to make The Jerry Zinger Show compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/200-jerry-zinger-show">report them on the forum!</a>
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Installation Order</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			&#10173; Although it is not required for The Jerry Zinger Show to function properly, ToB players are strongly recommended to download and install the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the recommended installation order:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>Please install The Jerry Zinger Show after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack and EET.</li>
			<li>Please install The Jerry Zinger Show before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.</li>
		</ul><br>

		<h2>Installation</h2><br>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-jz.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; jz folder.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a> or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.
		</p>><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Jerry Zinger Show for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; jz folder and a setup-jz.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-jz.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-jz.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>macOS</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Jerry Zinger Show for macOS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; jz folder, setup-jz and setup-jz.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-jz.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-jz.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Jerry Zinger Show for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu and weinstall to <span class="weidu">/usr/bin</span>. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;weinstall setup-jz&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine bgmain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> (or <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine baldur.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> for EE games), and start playing.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-jz --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: How do I experience the Jerry Zinger mod?</strong><br>
			A: The content of this mod occurs in the new area which can be accessed through the Den of Seven Vales, the inn north of the Circus in Waukeen's Promenade. The entrance to the new area is located on the south-east wall of the first floor of the inn, just slightly to the right of the point where you first enter the area.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: Hey, what's this? I thought this was a place for mods for the BG universe? How did I get here?</strong><br>
			A: No, you're in the right place. This IS a mod for the BG II game.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: Well, who is this 'Jerry Zinger', and what does he do? Is he related to the Jansen clan?</strong><br>
			A: No, he's a half-elf, and a famous television personality in Amn. He has a daily, er, 'talk show' dedicated to the ills of Western society.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: Oh, I see... He tries to help people.</strong><br>
			A: No, he exploits them.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: Just where did you come up with this insane idea?</strong><br>
			A: The idea was originally developed by MorningGlory but due to various circumstances, she were unable to continue the work. This resulted in Shed and SConrad taking over the project.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: What if I don't know about The Jerry Springer Show, Mr. Smarty Pants? Why should I care about this mod?</strong><br>
			A: Mocking other's problems and situations in a humorous is an age-old mechanism of the theatre. Plus, the original show is to be taken about as seriously as will be our mod. Rumour has it that the show's absurdity is actually scripted, but we have been assured that is a false allegation, and that it portrays real people with real problems.<br><br>
			Jerry Springer actually appears around the world. Might not air in Tibet, however. Check out the official Jerry Springer website if you've been living in Tibet and haven't heard of it. And, of course, check out your local television listings for both daytime television and night-time viewing. Check out the <a href="http://www.jerryzingertv.com">official web site</a> for the show.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: They didn't even HAVE television in Faerun! How are you gonna get around that one?</strong><br>
			A: They did have theaters, however. The equivalent of a studio, per se. And, I doubt if they had hot tubs in Faerun, either, but in the BG II game, I distinctly remember one in Aran Linvail's suite at the Shadow Thieves headquarters. So, who knows? Maybe the Jansens have the first television in Faerun. We all know how inventive Jan can bens.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Q: So, are you gonna have just one giant cut-scene, or what?</strong><br>
			A: No, the original show is a daily show, and we are going to attempt to do that, too. A blend of cut-scenes and some interactive stuff as well. Want the player to get in on the action, too, you know.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Hey, before I forget.. Just who's working on this piece of insanity?</strong><br>
			A: The team is headed by Shed and SConrad. A full list listing everyone's contributions will be available in the <a href=#credits>Credits</a>.
